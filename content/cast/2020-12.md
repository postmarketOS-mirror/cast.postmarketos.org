Our first podcast episode featuring @craftyguy, @PureTryOut, @z3ntu,
@MartijnBraam and @ollieparanoid (in order of appearance). We go into the
project's history and share a couple of anecdotes from before postmarketOS was
published until the creation of the PinePhone postmarketOS community edition in
2020.

Consider giving us some feedback (and questions for future episodes!) with
`#postmarketOSpodcast` on Mastodon or Twitter.
