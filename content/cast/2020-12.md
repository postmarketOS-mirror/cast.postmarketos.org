Our first podcast episode featuring @craftyguy, @PureTryOut, @z3ntu, @MartijnBraam, @ollieparanoid
(in order of appearance). 

On this episode, we will go into the project's history and share a couple of
anecdotes from before postmarketOS was published until the creation of the
PinePhone postmarketOS community edition in 2020. 

We are curious what you think about our first episode, so consider giving
us some feedback at the #postmarketOSpodcast hastag on Mastodon or Twitter.
