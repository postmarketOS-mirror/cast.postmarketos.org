The second episode of our podcast featuring @craftyguy, @z3ntu, @PureTryOut, @MartijnBraam and @ollieparanoid (in
order of appearance). 

This episode features a news update of the progress of some components of postmarketOS and we answer some of 
the #postmarketOSpodcast questions submitted after the release of the first episode.

We also added a [legacy mp3 rss-feed](https://postmarketos.org/blog/feed-legacy.atom) to the podcast for Apple devices.
